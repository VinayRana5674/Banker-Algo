# Check safe state
The bankerâ€™s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an state check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

Here i have created a structure name saftey which contains 3 array allocation,maximum,need which are 1-D array and one variable flag.
Than i started my main method which contains Menu for increase user simplicity, where i have created object of saftey S with size of 10.
